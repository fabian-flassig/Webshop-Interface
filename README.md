# Webshop-Interface
 **A demo of how to implement a Webshop interface as a PYTHA plugin

## Introduction

PYTHA offers a Webshop interface in XML language. This interface can e.g. load parametrized library elements, create some geometry primitives or assign attributes.

This PYTHA plugin acts as an example of how to implement similar functionality via the Lua Api. It mainly consists of two parts: the interface itself and an archive, where the completed jobs are stored.
